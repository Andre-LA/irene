# Irene
My personal game framework made on top of [Rotor-nelua](https://gitlab.com/Andre-LA/rotor-nelua) ECS library
and [Nene](https://github.com/Andre-LA/nene) game library.

You should clone this repository with
```
git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/Andre-LA/irene.git
```

## Dependencies

Both `rotor-nelua` and `nene` are bundled as git submodules, however, you also need to install [`nene`'s dependencies](https://github.com/Andre-LA/nene#dependencies).

## Running examples
Just run the following command, replacing "EXAMPLE" with one of the available examples on `tests` directory.
```
nelua tests/EXAMPLE.nelua
```
